### Hi there 👋
- 🤝 I am Konstantina. Welcome to my Github profile!😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🔭 I’m currently doing the Founders and Coders web development bootcamp in London (cohort 26).
- 🌱 I practice building websites without using third-party libraries.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects. At the moment, the journey (coding) amazes me more than the destination.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with some functions in JavaScript.
- 💬 Ask me about: Anything related to Legaltech and FinTech. Drop your knowledge on these...don't worry, you are not going to bore me (trained as Lawyer).
- 📫 How to reach me: [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinakatmada/)
-⚡ Fun fact: Notes 🎶 were the first language I learned before I learned to read and write. Many people consider 🎼 to be a programming language. I am of the same opinion, which means I believe I understood a programming language before I was able to fully understand my native "human" language.
 - ⚖️ My last reason to be pat myself at the back for once and stop being so self-critical: a certification ("Postgraduate Certificate in Laws in Banking and Finance law")	from the University of London

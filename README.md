### Hi there 👋
- 30 seconds to go:
-
-
- 🔭 I’m currently doing the Founders and Coders bootcamp (Space4, London).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning building websites without third-party libraries.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects- more interested in the journey than the destination 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Execute Program Quizzes.Some of them can be pretty daunting for me.
- 💬 Ask me about: Anything related to Legaltech and FinTech. Drop your knowledge on these...don't worry, you are not going to bore me (trained as Lawyer).
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinakatmada/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Notes 🎶 were the first language I learned before I learned to read and write. Many people consider 🎼 to be a programming language. I am of the same opinion, which means I believe I understood a programming language before I was able to fully understand my native "human" language.

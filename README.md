### Hi there 👋
- 🤝 I am Konstantina. Welcome to my Github profile!😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🔭 I have completed the Founders and Coders web development bootcamp in London (Cohort 26).
- 🌱 I have also completed a full-time training with Founders and Coders, both backend (Node.js,Express.js, Vite etc) and frontend (React), as employee of a small startup that provides services to charities.
- I have since moved on to working for the web app the clients of this startup use, as a mentee of the Head Engineer, using tech that you can not see at this github profile (Svelte, MySQL, PHP/ Laravel, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS)
-  I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects. At this point, the journey of getting to learn how to code amazes me more than the destination.
- 💬 Ask me about: Anything related to Legaltech and FinTech

- ⚡ Fun fact: Music notes 🎶 were the first language I learned before I learned to read and write. Many people consider 🎼 to be a programming language.
 - ⚖️ My last reason to pat myself at the back for once and stop being so self-critical: (in progress right now)

- 🌱 I practice building websites without using third-party libraries.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Musical notes 🎶 were the first language I learned before I learned to read and write. Many people consider 🎼 to be a programming language.
 - ⚖️ My last reason to pat myself at the back for once and stop being so self-critical: a certification ("Postgraduate Certificate in Laws in Banking and Finance law")	from the University of London
